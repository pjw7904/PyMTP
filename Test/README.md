Any script that mentions MTP **will not** work in this test directory, you have to move it to the pymtp directory where mtp.py is located. Not a huge deal, but don't panic if you want to test something and it doesn't know where to find something/what to do.

Python's ability to find custom libraries outside of the current directory isn't working and is **stupid**. Java makes this so easy.
