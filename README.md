# PyMTP

A simple, Python-based, software switch that runs the Meshed Tree Protocol (MTP) as its Layer 2 control-plane protocol and standard 802.1D bridging for data-plane forwarding

This switch is meant to easily display the functionality of MTP and to rapidly prototype modifications to the MTP standard.

The MTP-based switch can either be run independently on its own machine (using physical devices or a testbed like GENI) or via Mininet using the provided Mininet switch extension.
